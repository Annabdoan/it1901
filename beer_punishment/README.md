# Beer Punishment
### :nerd_face:  Motivation and purpose for the project :nerd_face: 
Group projects has a history of being a struggle. Working in teams can be found difficult, and therefore a set of rules is often created to secure a good experience. 
However, rules are often broken and punishments in forms of beers is assigned. 
The purpose of this application is to be a platform that has an overview of the rules to follow, and where punishments are tracked.
The group felt that this was something that was missing, and therefore decided to take manners into own hands.
