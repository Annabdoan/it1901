# Ui
We want the user interface to be easy to use. 
The app is structured with a header with the applications name, the main functionality on the right side and a view-list on the left side.

In order to build the user interface the group has used JavaFX to generate fxml-files for all scenes. 

To process user inputs and perform the wanted functionality we use the controller class. 


## The UI module consists of the following classes and files:
### Controller class:
* BeerController

### FXML files:
* Beer.fxml
