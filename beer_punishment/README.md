# Beer Punishment
### Motivation and purpose for the project
Many people struggle with group projects and working in teams, and find it difficult to follow the rules the group have agreed on.
The purpose of this app is to motivate group members to follow the agreed upon rules. 
The whole group benefits of the total punishments, by gathering the total of penalities for a social gathering.
We want to create an app for beer penalties to track penalties given to each member when they break a rule.  


### Userstories
Userstories for later releases will be added as functionality improves during later releases. 
#### Userstory release 1:
##### Story 1
> Anna arrives late to all meetings, and the group wants to punish Anna for this so that she can prepare herself for the future.
The group needs to create a beer punishment system that punishes people easily for various reasons. 
The group wants the system to keep track of rules for beer penalties. It's nice to keep track of what causes punishment, and thus how to avoid this.

##### Story 2
> Sara starts to get annoyed that Maurice is always on his mobile phone during the meetings, and wants mobile phone use to result in a beer penalty.
Sara needs to create a function that can add new rules to the beer penalty system.
