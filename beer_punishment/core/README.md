# Core
The core module consist of classes that perform the applications intended functionality. 
The core module also includes tests for functionality classes. 
The group has focused on testing all classes, and has tried to achieve a test coverage of at least 90% by using the Jacoco-plugin.
 
### The core module consists of the following classes and test classes:

#### Classes:
* BeerMain.java &rarr; Keeps track of....
* Rule.java &rarr; Generates Rule-objects

#### Test classes:
* BeerMainTest.java &rarr; Test for BeerMain.java
* RuleTest-java &rarr; TODOOOO


#### Connections between classes:
BeerMain uses the Rule class to make a list of rules that applies to the group. 
Rule.java generates a rule object, which can be added to the list of rules in BeerMain.
